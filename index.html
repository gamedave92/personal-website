                    <p > Hello, My name is David and well what can I say about myself you see I am someone who has always loved to work on computers either building a PC, Video and Audio I do run a YouTube channel <br>
                        and  trying to start a podcast, and I also trying to learn more about the different technology that comes with being a Front End Web Dev. <br> I also started to dabble a bit when it comes to coding when it comes to coding I have dabble it bit before that started with RPG Maker VX back in the day, that program used Ruby Game Scripting System 2 and when I started this I thought it was fun but I decided to switch to learning on how to make websites and so far I have started with HTML and CSS and I am in the process of learning more about CSS before I start to go ahead and head first into JS, JavaScript. <br>
                        My goal is to use this website that I am making now to one day become a portfolio website. 
                        If you made it this far thanks for reading my about section.

                            <p>
                                Some of the projects that I have worked on are simple projects that have been made with just HTML and CSS some of these projects I have done by learning from different platforms such as <a href="https://www.codedex.io/">Codedex.io</a>, <a href="https://scrimba.com/">Scrimba</a> and <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/">SoloLearn</a>. 
                                <br>
                                What I have learned from making projects are some of the following and also will have links to the pages as well. For one of my projects I made a birthday website and I chose a sujbject and it was Jim Henson, 
                                I mean who dose not love The Muppets, But I wanted to make the website to show how I can use emoji's HTML and CSS to make a hover effect that would show the gif picture it was like opening up a gift. <br>

                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The next project that I made was a login page while it does not have any functionality but what I wanted to show was that I was  able to make to make this with just HTML and CSS and used the ccolor gradient effect to style the header that says login and the button. <br>
                                <br>

                                The last project I worked on, This was from Codedex.io that taught me more CSS and how to make a stick postion, how to make a unlisted navbar, list style type, how to style different headers and building a static website. <br>

                                These projects show what skills I have at this moment but as time goes on this section will be changed when I make more projects/websits. &#128513
