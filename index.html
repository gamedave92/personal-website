        <h3>About me</h3>
            <p > Hello, My name is David and well what can I say about myself you see I am someone who has always loved to work on computers either building a PC, Video and Audio I do run a YouTube channel <br>
                and  trying to start a podcast, and I also trying to learn more about the different technology that comes with being a Front End Web Dev. <br> I also started to dabble a bit when it comes to coding when it comes to coding I have dabble it bit before that started with RPG Maker VX back in the day, that program used Ruby Game Scripting System 2 and when I started this I thought it was fun but I decided to switch to learning on how to make websites and so far I have started with HTML and CSS and I am in the process of learning more about CSS before I start to go ahead and head first into JS, JavaScript. <br>
                My goal is to use this website that I am making now to one day become a portfolio website. 
                If you made it this far thanks for reading my about section.
