So I started building the web page and once I had a rough draft ready to go I setup my GitHub to upload my code here to getup and made sure to test that netlify is able to host the new website and sync any changes to the website once that was done I went ahead got the 
background colors for the website and then made a simple navbar while it is a start I am not to sure on how to make it edges shorter than they are now.

Today I went ahead and added a profile picture to the web page, added sub text under the profile picture, added in a h2 element, made about sections started wit the border and added a gradient effect to it chose yellow and purple color to make the border stand out,
added a paragraph to my web page for the about me. For the whole website I added a google font and for the profile picture I used the South Park character generator to make my profile picture.

I finally have the basic version of this website setup finally and wanted to get it done. So what I did do was finish the about me, projects and contact sections done and I have upgraded the code for both HTML and CSS and the website has been updated after I have had  my 
github desktop app confinguered. For now this basic website will have to do till I go ahead and get more skills to upload to this site or decided to keep the site as it is so that way I can compare and see how far I have come on my coding journey. :D
